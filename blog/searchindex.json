The only thing that kept me away from writing is set of tools which are easy, quick and more imporantly can fuse with my day-to-day note taking process.\nSwith to Joplin I was using Boostnote as note taking app but it lacks mobile app, web-clipper and sychronization features; moreover it became very buggy lately. Then I switched to Jopline and it has all the feature as note taking app I was looking for.\nSwitching from Boostnote to Joplin is very straight forward.\n Export notes from Boostnote as markdown. Import them in Joplin. Fix images and tags by manually copying them.  I don\u0026rsquo;t know if there\u0026rsquo;s any automated way but I could do that since I had just started taking notes and didn\u0026rsquo;t have many of them.\nHugo: Joplin to A Blog Hugo is a static site generator and moderately simple. So the idea is to convert Joplin files to Hugo markdown format and publish them automatically to GitHub Pages.\nRequirements  Github account Google Drive Insync (this is optional. You can choose any to sync Joplin directory to Google Drive.)  Steps   Make Joplin notes available publically.\n Sync Joplin to local directory. Directory is synced to Google Drive via Insync. Share the Google Drive directory as Anyone with Link option.    Get Google service account credential.\n Create a new project if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any at Developer Console Enable Google Drive API.   Create a service account, furnish a new private key and download it in JSON format.    Prepare a GitHub Page respository.\n Create a GitHub Page respository. Create two branches: www and master  Make www as default branch. www branch is where (http://mysite.com) Hugo source and Joplin to Hugo converter script will live. master branch is where actual static site will live. GitHub doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow any other branch to publish content in personal account.   Add following attribute to repository\u0026rsquo;s secret.  GD_FOLDER_ID: \u0026lt;shared Joplin\u0026rsquo;s Goole Drive folder id\u0026gt; GD_SERVICE_ACC_INFO: Service account\u0026rsquo;s json file content.      Enable GitHub Action and edit workflow to do the followings.\n Enable action on push and schedule. Check out www branches with their submodule to www directory. Change python version to 3.7 Run converter script that pull drive content to temporary location and output content to www/post Check out master branch to www/public directory. Build www with Hugo. Commit and push www/public (this is a master branch).    Here is the GitHub Repository of my setup for your reference. I host two separate static sites: https://abhi9.in for my website and https://abhi9.in/blog for my blog.\nThis enables me to write from any device and publish a blog post from anywhere.\n","id":2,"section":"posts","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s been quite a while since I was thinking about writing a blog.
